One of the primary goals of this thesis was to summarize the current knowledge
about resonance Raman measurements of nucleic acids and critically analyze the
results regarding own measurements of NA model molecules to
create a reliable interpretation table for further NA studies via UV RRS.
Resonance Raman spectra of building blocks of nucleic acids AMP (250\,\g{m}M),
TMP (500\,\g{m}M), GMP (375\,\g{m}M) and polyC (500\,\g{m}M) and melting their
simple complexes poly(dAdT) (500\,\g{m}M), polyG (375\,\g{m}M) and
polyG$\cdot$polyC (500\,\g{m}M) were measured for that purpose.
The concentrations of the samples are in nucleic bases.

The Raman spectra were excited at 244\,nm and the samples were measured at
20\,\textdegree{}C or in the range from 5\,\textdegree{}C to 95\,\textdegree{}C
with the 5\,\textdegree{}C step.

Melting curves of the spectra were analyzed by means of PCA, and the spectrum
at 5\,\textdegree{}C and 95\,\textdegree{}C was constructed from the first 4
principal components.

The results of the measurements normalized to the same concentrations of
nucleobases are displayed in
\cref{%
	\figlabel{interpretation:at},%
	\figlabel{interpretation:gc}%
}.
It means that the spectra of complexes that contain two types of nucleobases
were doubled in intensity to make them directly comparable.
The spectra were decomposed to the Gaussian and Lorentzian curve combinations.
The bands' positions resulting from the fit shown in the figures with their
intensities were estimated.
The precision of the well-resolved bands is better than 2\,\icm{} in position
and 10\,\% in intensity but significantly lowers on overlapped bands.
Finally, the available literature was searched for the band assignments and
added to the interpretation tables (see full text of the work).
This information was then used in the next scientific work in this thesis, and
the table was also enhanced for the information from these works.

Published calculations of the vibration modes of mostly simple molecules like
methylated bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides and experimental studies on
structural information of NA were reviewed and used to construct
interpretation tables.
Even though there were some differences between the published data, the
majority of Raman bands in the measured area could be assigned to fundamental
transitions of vibrational modes localized at least in large part on the
nucleobases.
